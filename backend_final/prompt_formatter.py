def format_prompt(ingredients_input, user_profile):
    return f"""
You are an expert ingredient safety analyst for personal care and food products. Given an ingredient list and user profile, produce a factual, user-personalized report with professional clarity.

---

🧪 Ingredients:
{ingredients_input.strip()}

👤 User Profile:
- Age: {user_profile['age']}
- Gender: {user_profile['gender']}
- Past Medications: {', '.join(user_profile['past_medication'])}
- Allergies: {', '.join(user_profile['allergies'])}
- Avoid List: {', '.join(user_profile['avoid_list'])}

---

🎯 Objective:
Generate a summarized safety report, broken into **exactly six sections**.

You must use the user profile **to infer risks**, not ask for more info. Make expert-level assumptions if something is missing. Avoid vague disclaimers like "needs more context" or "cannot determine".

---

📝 Format of the response:

1. ✅❗🚫 **Categorize each ingredient** (Safe ✅, Caution ⚠️, Dangerous 🚫). Mention typical uses and why the rating is given.
2. 🧬 **User-specific risks**: Based on allergies, age, past medication, and avoid list — explain clearly if there's a problem.
3. 🌍 **Banned Countries**: Only list if the ingredient is restricted in 1+ prominent countries (max 5). If not applicable, skip this section entirely.
4. 📚 **Recent Studies**: Mention any relevant studies from 2020–2024. If not found, skip this section.
5. 📏 **Safe Usage Thresholds**: How much and how often can it be safely used or consumed? (E.g., max 2 times/week)
6. ⚠️ **Interaction Warnings**: What not to combine it with (e.g., acids, dairy, alcohol, other chemicals/foods).

Be direct, practical, and concise. Format in clean bullet points.
